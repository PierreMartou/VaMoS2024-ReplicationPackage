# Replication package for "Combinatorial Transition Testing in Dynamically Adaptive Systems" submitted to VaMoS24.

This replication package aims at reproducing results for the Section 7 of "Combinatorial Transition Testing in Dynamically Adaptive Systems" by -authors hidden for now-, at VaMoS2024.

## Requirements
The code needs python3+ to execute correctly. It also requires several packages, which are detailed below:

- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- python-sat

  This list is also in "requirements.txt" in order to install these packages easily by using "pip install -r requirements.txt" (only on Linux machines).

  ## Usage

  You simply need to launch main.py with no parameters (i.e. "python3 main"). All parameters are explained and chosen at runtime.
